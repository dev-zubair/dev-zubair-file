            <h1><span class="name-span">Tim Templeton's</span> World!</h1>
            <h3>Timothy Leslie "Tim" Templeton is the main character of The Boss Baby franchise. </h3>
            <p><b>Timothy Templeton</b> is the firstborn son to Mr. and Mrs. Templeton. He is seven and a half years old
                and is
                shown to be quite the imaginative and happy boy, and he likes his life as an only child. One morning he
                wakes up to the sound of the alarm clock and looks out the window to see a taxi arriving. Out of the
                taxi, appears Boss Baby dressed in a suit and tie. A shocked Tim runs downstairs to confront his parents
                only to see them introduce him to his new younger brother.

            <h1>Physical appearance & Personality</h1>
            <h3>Tim has a really wild imagination</h3>
            <p>He has very large eyes, and usually wears quite casual clothes unless his parents have special outfits
                for him. He constantly dreams about parallel worlds in any situation, making him quite bouncy at times.
                However, due to this, his parents sometime question his behavior and whether he is always telling the
                truth. He has also shown to be quite a strong boy for his age, as he is able to take on Francis E.

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <h4><em>Directed by - Tom McGrath</em></h4>
                <p>Upon reading the original book on which the film is based McGrath felt a connection to it, as he had
                    an older brother and felt like "the boss baby of the family". In keeping with that theme he stated,
                    in an interview with Den of Geek, that "My personal goal with this was to watch this movie with my
                    brother, and to see how it affected him!", which resulted in McGrath's brother being moved to tears
                    by the completed film.</p>

                <h2>Pre-Production</h2>
                <h4><em>Produced by - Ramsey Ann Naito</em></h4>
                <p>In September 2014, Alec Baldwin and Kevin Spacey joined the cast of the film, with further casting
                    news announced in June 2016, including Steve Buscemi replacing Spacey. Miles Bakshi, son of the
                    DreamWorks Animation's producer Gina Shay and grandson of the film director Ralph Bakshi, who
                    directed the 1972 American adult animated comedy film Fritz the Cat, provided the voice of 7-year
                    old Tim. </p>
